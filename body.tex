\section{Introduction}

We need a workflow system and production tools which can process DESC DC2 for DP0.2. Nominally the processing starts in June 2021.
We have a milestone L3-MW-0050 in March (see \tabref{tab:miles}) for Batch system installation and configurations on IDF and L3-MW-0060 for the DP0.2 production.
The preferable way to do this would be with BPS in front of PanDA but there are potentially other solutions (see \secref{sec:potential}).

For PREOPS we should focus on PanDA in the near term get all the hooks in place and make it work for DP0.2.
Getting this in place requires some leadership and decision making. We need a product owner and manager  (see \secref{sec:team}).
This is separate from the construction side's HSC reprocessing at NCSA for development needs. The  constructions team at NCSA can continue to use Condor-based BPS for the biweekly HSC reprocessing at NCSA.

How effective these tools are will determine how effort-intensive (and successful) the large-scale processing campaigns will be.


\subsection{Milestones}
General DP0 information is  \citeds{RTN-001}. For simplicity some  milestones
are copied here in \tabref{tab:miles}. Jira is the source of truth for dates on these though some may need revising.

\section {Requirements and priories}
\citeds{LDM-636} forms the formal requirements baseline.

Concisely we need the execution team to be able to run DP0.2 with minimum hand holding.
Hence the top priorities for the near term would be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Documentation: preferably on lsst.io, enough for the execution team to kick off pipelines,  monitor and to first order troubleshoot them.
\item Workflow monitoring - some sort of web page which gives status (perhaps slightly customized)
\item Restart: Can resume an unfinished workflow. Can automatically retry jobs killed by preemption, DB connection, or other transient issues.
\item Logstash: On IDF this will be Google Logging. Any logging should end up in the same central logging system.
\item Troubleshooting failed jobs: Features to help understand non-transient failures, such as error messages aggregation and ways to reproduce failures. This kind of error usually is caused by pipeline failures and needs follow-up investigation.
\end{enumerate}
Longer term (which may not be for DP0.2)we need
\begin{itemize}
\item Installation at SLAC
\item Multi site execution with France and eventually UK.
\item Campaign execution monitoring
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Timeline}
We have a milestone L3-MW-0050 in March (see \tabref{tab:miles}) for Batch system installation and configurations on IDF and L3-MW-0060 for the DP0.2 production.
We should track these two milestones: L3-MW-0050 for an initial system and L3-MW-0060 to
have the system to run DP0.2.

\subsection{Evaluation}
L3-MW-0060 will see the commencement of the processing run - we assume there may be some
hiccups  at that point. But at L3-MW-0060 + one month we should decide if this is the long term approach for Rubin Operations with DOE buy in.
Hence L3-MW-0040 is approximately the evaluation date.

\section {Team }\label{sec:team}
SLAC obviously have long term interest in this working and on a single track so it would be good to have some SLAC oversight on the topic.
A product owner to shepherd requirements and priorities as well as  a manager to guide resources must be identified.
 Currently (all at partial fractions) the team consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Brian Yanny and team at FERMILAB for execution
\item Monica Adamow - Execution NCSA
\item Michelle Gower, Mikolaj Kowalik  - BPS and deployment
\item Sergey Padowski and Shuwei Ye (starting in January)- PanDA
\end{itemize}

\section{PanDA}

The PanDA (``Processing and Data Analysis'') system was created by
ATLAS at LHC to manage its massive processing efforts. In that
capacity it handles several hundred thousand processing jobs per day
across heterogeneous systems, supporting multiple parallel
campaigns. Its main services (PanDA, Harvester, iDDS) are driven from
a central database. The system can ingest DAGs, handle the workflow
and then the workload management. Currently PanDA cannot rerun parts
of workflow, but the feature is being actively considered for addition.

PanDA satisfies a number of criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item Multi-site authentication
\item Multi-site processing - Harvester can be used to mitigate network traffic between sites and central workflow db; also handles site-specific submission properties allowing a range of different kinds of resources
\item Manages workflow (via iDDS) as well as workload
\item Good monitoring tools for the submitted workflow. Can be customized.
\end{itemize}

While support would be dependent on BNL expertise, several
installations of PanDA have been undertaken outside of ATLAS, so there
is experience in doing installs and of ongoing maintenance for other
organizations.

In order to demonstrate the viability and customizability of PanDA for
Rubin, BNL has set a target of doing processing with PanDA in the IDF
by the March 2021 time frame. As a part of that demonstration, they
will provide documentation of the PanDA system.

It would be additionally instructive to set up multi-site processing
to include the French Data Facility and US Data Facility during 2021.

However, campaign management is outside PanDAâ€™s scope, so a layer on ctrl\_bps would be needed to chunk up and keep track of elements of a campaign. Ctrl\_bps would likely also need to handle resubmissions.




\section {Potential solutions} \label{sec:potential}

Conceptually this is done in two steps: (a) workflow generation and (b) job execution.
In step (a) the workflow generation defines executable jobs and job interdependency as a graph.
In step (b) job execution includes workflow status monitoring, pausing/resuming/killing workflows, debugging/retrying failed jobs, resource usage monitoring, and relevant toolkits to facilitate execution management on a large scale.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  ctrl\_bps workflow generation + PanDA-plugin execution tools developed by BNL
\item ctrl\_bps workflow generation + Condor-plugin execution tools developed by NCSA
\item ctrl\_bps workflow generation + Pegasus as the execution tools
\item ctrl\_bps workflow generation tools can't work on IDF, one can use customized scripts to generate workflow for any execution tools.
\end{enumerate}



\section {Risks and worries}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Lack of documentation for PanDA: it is a complex system and will
  be the heart of processing.. operating for 12 years in this mode is unwise.\label{i:nodoc}
\item Dependence on an institution or individual because of
  \ref{i:nodoc}, also suggests the need to spread the expertise more
  broadly across the team.
\item Having a LOT of scripting to make a production run of any size
\item dependence on Oracle: is an open source project would you not like to depend on commercial products furthermore some of us have had bad experience with Oracle.
\end{enumerate}
